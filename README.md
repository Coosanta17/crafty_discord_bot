# Crafty Controller Discord Bot.

> A Discord Bot to interact with and control [Crafty Controller](https://craftycontrol.com/) through commands in chat 

So far all it does is start *one* server.

### How to use
A basic knowledge of command line is assumed. 

The bot has been developed and tested in Node version `20.13.1`. Later versions should be fine, however unknown problems may happen.

1. Install NodeJs and import the repository, then run the command in the repository folder:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the bot using command
   ```bash
   node .
   ```

3. Set up configuration file located in `./config.json` (see [Configuration File](#config)).

5. Set up permissions and roles. In discord developer portal, in the bot tab under "Privileged Gateway Intents" allow "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT". In Crafty Controller [set up a role](https://docs.craftycontrol.com/pages/user-guide/user-role-config/#adding-a-role) with api key, server access and COMMANDS permissions to the desired server.

6. Start the bot (step 2).

### Configuration File
Here is the default configuration file, it will be located one directory up from `./src`:
```json
{
    "bot": {
        "token": "BOT_TOKEN"
    },
    "crafty": {
        "api_token": "CRAFTY_TOKEN",
        "server_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "url": "https://localhost:8443/"
    },
    "commands": {
        "slash": {
            "enabled": true
        },
        "text": {
            "enabled": false,
            "prefix": "!"
        }
    },
    "auto_stop": {
        "enabled": true,
        "check_interval": 2,
        "empty_wait_time": 30
    },
    "stop_command": {
        "enabled": false,
    }
}
```


- `bot.token` - The discord bot's token. Learn how to get one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvK-ZigEV4Q), make sure it has MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT allowed.


- `crafty:`

    - `api_token` - The api token for [crafty controller user](https://docs.craftycontrol.com/pages/user-guide/user-role-config/#adding-a-role), make sure it has the COMMANDS permission and access to the server.

    - `server_id` - The [uuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) of the server. You can find it in the link to the server near the end.

    - `url` - The url to access the controller


- `commmands:`

    - `slash.enabled` - Whether slash commands are enabled, recommended `true`

    - `text.enabled` and `text.prefix` - Whether text commands are enabled, for example, if prefix if set to `!`, help command would be `!help`. Can be useful if slash commands are not working or personal preference.

- `auto_stop:`

    - `enabled` - Whether the server will automatically stop.

    - `check_interval` - How often the bot will ping Crafty Controller in minutes, 2 minutes is usually alright, as too often may result in high network traffic, and too far apart may result in the server shutting down later than the wait time.

    - `empty_wait_time` - How long (in minutes) the server needs to be empty before shutting down.

- `stop_command.enabled` - Whether the `/stop` command is enabled or not. This will not override or replace auto stop if both are enabled. Permissions have not been set up yet so anyone can stop the server, however it is a future feature coming soonâ„¢!!
